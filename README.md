Graph Alignment using Node Embeddings
This notebook presents the implementation of graph alignment using node embeddings generated by the node2vec algorithm. The process involves aligning nodes from two different graphs by learning a mapping between their respective embeddings. The notebook is organized into several sections, each corresponding to a specific task in the graph alignment process.

Contents:
Introduction
Brief overview of the notebook's purpose and organization.
Setup
Mounting Google Drive and installing required libraries (node2vec, networkx).
Data Preparation
Reading graph data from CSV files.
Building adjacency lists for both graphs.
Generating node embeddings using node2vec.
Graph Alignment
Preparing input and output matrices for training.
Training a neural network to learn the mapping between embeddings.
Using a KNN classifier to predict alignment for unmarked nodes.
Evaluation
Assessing the accuracy of the alignment on training data.
Usage:
To run the notebook:

Set up the environment:
Mount your Google Drive containing the required CSV files.
Install the necessary libraries (node2vec, networkx).
Upload graph data:
Ensure that the CSV files containing edge lists and anchor mappings are correctly located in your Google Drive.
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially:
Run each cell to load the data, generate embeddings, train the alignment model, and evaluate its performance.
Review the results:
Examine the accuracy of the alignment on the training data to assess the quality of the learned mapping.
Requirements:
Python 3
Google Colab (or similar)
node2vec
NetworkX
PyTorch
scikit-learn
